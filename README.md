# Project__Cryptography-Software-Security-File-Transfer

Cryptography: Successfully transfer file using cryptography protocol for security â€“ SSL, AES, RSA, DH, Hash 

--> generated public and private key (g^26 digit long - developed algorithm for lager number expo & mod) 
--> Verified key for both Client and server(TCP), generated nonce, key is encrypted with AES. Use OpenSSL standards 
--> Use RSA and DH for more security. Generated Hash128 at both side and verified it for file integrity
